# Libraries

## Main `physiopy` packages
`physiopy` is a set of tools to operate physiological files in MRI setups. These include cardiac pulsation, respiration, blood gases, and skin conductance. The toolbox consists of three primary packages, each of which is described more extensively under the library section. 

### `Phys2bids`
`Phys2bids` is a Python [package](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids) that turns physiological files into the BIDS format. Given the preponderance of physiological data formats, there was no singular software package that could accommodate any data file thrown at it. This tool provides a standardized naming convention for physiological data. Follow the links for more information on how to [install](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and [use](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto.html) `phys2bids`, as well as the importance of [standarization to BIDS](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bids.html) format and [more](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### `Peakdet` 
The`peakdet` [package](https://github.com/physiopy/peakdet) is designed for reproducible processing and analysis of physiological data. These include those collected from respiratory belts, pulse photoplethysmography, or electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) monitors. For more information on [installation and setup](https://peakdet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as well as the [user guide](https://peakdet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) follow the provided links.

### `Phys2denoise`
The `phys2denoise` package is currently under development, see [link](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2denoise) for current repository and status. Any suggestions/bug report is welcome! Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2denoise/issues).
