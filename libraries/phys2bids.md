# Phys2bids
### A python3 library to format physiological files in BIDS
It was born for AcqKnowledge files (BIOPAC), and at the moment it supports `.acq` files as well as `.txt` files obtained by labchart (ADInstruments). It doesn't support physiological files recorded with the MRI, as you can find software for it here. 

### Overview
The Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS) is the most commonly used standard for organizing neuroimaging data. `Phys2bids` was origianlly developed by neuroscientists who wanted to standarize the ability to examine the relationship between physiology and brain function as there are many different data formats. Follow the links for more information on how to [install](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and [use](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto.html) `phys2bids`, as well as the importance of [standarization to BIDS](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bids.html) format and [more](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
