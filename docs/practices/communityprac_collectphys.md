[Community Practices for Acquiring Physiological Data](#bestpractice)
================================================

In this section we discuss common methods of setting up and acquiring physiological 
data. For all signals, acquiring a continuous time course is recommended for the 
greatest impact on your MR data. If that is not possible, however, it is helpful 
to record for anywhere from 15-30 seconds before and after each distinct functional 
acquisition to capture subject-specific features of physiological data. 
 
Prior to the start of each distinct scan, the physiological recordings should be 
assessed for any data quality issues and fixed prior to the acquisition. Oftentimes 
this can occur from slightly misplaced or loose equipment from either subject 
movement or hardware malfunction. If you are not careful to ensure high quality in 
your data acquisition, then the signals you take the extra time and attention to 
collect will not be usable to model your MR data. 

Cardiac Pulsation
-------------------------------

Cardiac pulsation can be collected using an optical technique called photoplethysmography 
(PPG) or electrocardiography (ECG), which records electrical activity.  

**PPG** relies on the interaction of light with the tissues, using a light source 
and a photodetector, placed on the fingertip (or ear lobe, toe, or other pulse point). 
The source (usually an infra-red or green LED) emits light towards the tissue and 
the photodetector captures the transmitted/reflected light (for the transmissive 
and reflective sensor types, respectively). This allows us to monitor variations in 
blood circulation, since they affect the amount of light that is detected. The AC 
component of the PPG represents changes in blood volume, which depend on the 
systolic and diastolic phases of the cardiac activity. Since the acquisition and 
transmission are conducted by optical fiber, the signal does not suffer from any 
MRI interference while scanning.

These devices are typically included in the MRI scanner infrastructure. The data 
can thus be collected by the scanner, or recorded by a separate device. Typically 
the peaks of the cardiac pulsation trace are identified (e.g., the timing of each 
heart beat). Prior to using a PPG device in the scanner it is helpful to visualize 
what a normal PPG signal might look like by testing on yourself. You may also mimic 
common noise scenarios such as finger twitching, movement, or an ill-fitting device 
so you can anticipate issues during the scan. Once the subject is in the scanner, a 
continuous signal containing periodic features with clear peaks and troughs is 
expected. The amplitude should be sufficient to detect peaks, and it should always 
be evaluated after each scan to ensure there is no need to reposition [QC19.05.22] 
https://www.biopac.com/knowledge-base/ppg-setup-and-calibration/  

**ECG** traces the potential change over the heart generated by the sinoatrial (SA) 
and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. It provides very precise beat-by-beat HR 
information. Depending on the system you are using and whether it is connected to 
another device (e.g., EEG cap), the electrodes can be placed on the chest or on the 
back of the subject. The ECG allows us to clearly monitor the entire QRS complex 
and cardiac cycle of the patient. 

It is important to note that like most signals, the ECG is susceptible to artifacts 
introduced by magnetic induction and RF pulses and produces cardio-ballistic 
effects from the mechanical movement of the heart and flow of blood in the magnetic 
field that need to be cleaned appropriately after the scan (Kugel et al., 2003). 
Certain commercial devices have built in filters to suppress MRI-related artifacts, 
however understanding what is real and noise in your signal is essential prior to 
using it for any kind of analysis (Abacherli, et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2009; 
Odille et al., 2007). To best avoid motion artifacts you should ask the subject 
to remain as still as possible while in the scanner. Additionally, the conductive 
cables should be minimized in length, fastened well with tape to the body, and 
should never be looped. Visual inspection of proper peak detection is highly 
recommended to ensure that post-processed peak classification was not due to any 
residual artifact or signal distortion (Wong et al., 2011).
		
Both ECG and PPG methods are commonly used by the neuroimaging community. In a 
recent meta-analysis of cardiac function and cortical thickness that pooled 
structural MRI and heart rate data from 20 research groups, half of the groups used 
PPG to estimate heart rate data; the other half, ECG (Koenig et al., 2021). Both 
ECG and PPG have strengths and weaknesses, however, and the choice between the two 
depends on investigators’ intended use of the data. Cardiac data can be useful in 
mitigating the effect of cardiac pulsations on the BOLD signal itself (i.e., for 
denoising fMRI data) or to investigate the neural correlates of cardiac function. 
For denoising concurrently collected fMRI data using approaches like RETROICOR 
(Glover et al., 2000) or DRIFTER (Särkkä et al., 2012), cardiac pulse estimates 
from either ECG or PPG can be used. In this case, PPG has the advantage as its 
sensor is easier to place and its signal is less susceptible to MR-induced 
artifacts (Caballero-Gaudes et al., 2017). On the other hand, data from ECG and 
PPG are not equally well-suited to some assessments of the neural bases of cardiac 
function. While they provide nearly equivalent estimates of heart rate, PPG does 
not provide reliable estimates of heart rate variability (Jan et al., 2019; 
Mejía-Mejía et al., 2021; Schumann et al., 2021; Yuda et al., 2020). Finally, 
while placement of a PPG sensor on the finger or foot is easier, quicker, and 
less invasive than that of electrodes on the thorax, PPG is susceptible to 
motion-induced noise (Lu et al., 2009), which is greater in some populations than 
others. Altogether, choice of PPG or ECG for cardiac monitoring should depend on 
the data’s intended use and the concomitant MR sequence (Bottenhorn et al., 2021).

**MRI cardiac data** is another common method to capture the cardiac cycle and 
heart rate peaks. Most groups using this method of acquisition work with scanner 
vendors for collecting these data as they have existing methods and materials on 
how to best use their system. While no method is perfect, the claim of MR cardiac 
acquisition is to provide an ideal method to bypass scanner noise [QC 19.05.22]. 

Respiration
-------------------------------
Breathing is typically monitored using a \"respiratory belt\" around the participant's 
chest/diaphragm. The belt may be rigid or elastic, using MR compatible force or 
pressure transducers to generate a signal proportional to the chest diameter. Often 
a belt is incorporated into the MRI scanner infrastructure, and this data can be 
collected by the scanner or recorded by a separate device. The optimal positioning 
of the belt depends on the device being used, however it is best to be fairly 
consistent in how the belt is worn throughout a study. In some labs, multiple belts 
are used to better capture different types of breathing styles 
(e.g., \"chest breathing\" versus \"belly breathing\"). When used during fMRI, the 
breathing belt should be tested in the horizontal position, even if the preparation 
is performed while standing/sitting, since the supine position will likely be 
adopted throughout the whole scan and the breathing style or belt tightness may 
differ. 

After setting up the belt, a continuous sinusoidal shape is expected, following the 
breathing pattern, that should present clear peaks and troughs. Usually, no standard 
units are used, and the metrics will rely on the relative changes between inhalation 
and exhalation. This will provide information about the breathing depth and 
frequency. Note that while belts are commonly referred to as capturing respiration, 
they are more aptly capturing ventilation via chest position.

Before starting the experiment, the resting voltage of the respiration belt should 
be checked to assess the dynamic range [SETUP_170322]. The subject should be asked 
to take a full breath in and out. If the tip of the curve is flat, the signal is 
probably saturating and the position of the belt should be adjusted. If the belt is 
too tight or too loose, it is more likely to saturate. Nevertheless, it has to be 
tight enough for the correct detection of peaks and troughs that will be needed 
afterwards [QC_190522]. It is recommended that you are familiar with the values at 
which your belt saturates on both ends. This can be evaluated through trial and 
error when testing your equipment after purchase. Depending on the application, it 
may still be possible to work with imperfect data, even if the curve is slightly 
flat.

For a sanity check, the normal breathing rate may be used as reference, since 10-20 breaths per minute, with each breath taking around 3 to 6 s, are expected. Note that certain clinical populations may have varied breathing rates, for example, faster breathing rates are expected for pediatric populations. Asking the subject to perform simple tests, such as holding their breath or following a paced breathing rhythm, will also ensure that the recording system is responding adequately [SETUP_170322].

One should also bear in mind that the subjects may experience nervousness, especially if it is their first scan, which may cause hyperventilation at the beginning of the acquisition. If possible, they should have some time to adapt to the new environment or the experiment could start with a structural scan to leave some adaptation time before the first functional scan [QC_190522].

Although the respiratory belt is usually used to retrieve respiration, it is also 
possible not to rely on it. On the one hand, a respiratory trace may still be 
obtained directly when respiratory sensors are already embedded into the scanner, 
without the need for a respiratory belt. On the other hand, it may also be obtained 
indirectly, for example from the ECG or even the fMRI itself. Respiration modulates 
the ECG, changing the morphology of the heartbeats and the electrical impedance of 
the thoracic cavity, due to filling/emptying of the lungs, and affecting the heart 
rate. Therefore, an ECG-derived respiration (EDR) may be obtained 
(Varon et al., 2020), which has already been tested in the MRI environment, 
showing the feasibility of using physiological models relying exclusively on ECG 
data to explain both respiratory and cardiac effects (Abreu et al., 2016). 
Respiratory effects may also be accounted for by using image-based data-driven 
methods, by extracting CSF and white matter time courses as regressors of no 
interest or by decomposing the data using PCA or ICA to find respiration-related 
components. More recently, machine learning and deep learning models are also being 
applied to infer respiratory information based on fMRI spatiotemporal patterns 
(Bayrak et al., 2020; Addeh et al., 2023).

Blood Gasses
-------------------------------
Information related to the level of blood gasses is also an important factor when 
analysing fMRI data. An increase in arterial carbon dioxide (CO2) levels is known 
to have vasodilatory effects, driving large variability in blood flow and the BOLD 
signal (Birn et al. 2006, Wise et al. 2004). Although oxygen (O2) levels are known 
to have mild vasoconstrictive effects on the cerebrovasculature, these O2 levels 
can directly influence BOLD signal contrast (Bulte et al. 2007). 

Arterial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen (PaCO2 and PaO2, respectively) can 
be measured directly through the invasive process of arterial sampling. Non-invasive 
approaches include measurement of the end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide and 
oxygen at the end of an exhalation (PetCO2 and PetO2) 
(Bengtsson et al. 2001, McSwain et al. 2010). These measurements are commonly used 
as surrogates of PaCO2 and PaO2 and are sampled with the use of a nasal 
cannula/face mask that is connected through a long tube to a gas analyser located 
in the control room. 

Sampling of respiratory gasses can be performed in combination with the delivery of 
gasses, and this might lead to some issues/challenges when collecting and analysing 
data. Given that delivery of gasses is not our focus, if interested in combining 
delivery and sampling of respiratory gasses, we recommend reading Bulte and 
Wartolowska (2017) Neuroimage 154:81-91.

A nasal cannula is the simplest way to sample and/or monitor respiratory gasses. 
Consider using a nasal cannula with a mouth scoop to better capture mouth breathing.
In terms of gas analysis devices, these can be split into two different design groups 
based on the number of pumps per gas. There can be one pump per gas or one pump for 
all gasses. If two air pumps are connected to the same sample line, they must be 
carefully balanced, with all pumps having similar drawing power and no blockage 
being observed in any of the pump’s lines. Regarding sampling frequencies, most 
acquisition systems sample at a default frequency (usually 1kHz) that is much higher 
than the normal respiration rate (~0.2Hz). A frequency of 100Hz should provide 
sufficient temporal resolution but, if necessary, this value might be decreased and 
still provide a good signal (e.g. 10Hz provides 50 to 100 points per cycle).
